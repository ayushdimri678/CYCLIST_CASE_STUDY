I have just completed my core learning from google data analytics course from coursera now I am ready to make my first capstone project.
In the given case study I work as a junior data analyst In a fictional company Cyclistic , Cyclistic Is a bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.
Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred as casual riders whereas the Customers who purchase annual memberships are called Cyclistic members. 
Cyclistic finance analysts have concluded that members are more profitable than casual riders so the objective of the case study is to find how members use bike differently from casual riders and how can we pursue casual riders to buy the yearly membership.
Me and my team have to make a detailed presentation and present It in front of shareholders to get their approval
