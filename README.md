ABOUT*

I have just completed my core learning from google data analytics course from coursera now I am ready to make my first capstone project.
In the given case study I work as a junior data analyst In a fictional company Cyclistic , Cyclistic Is a bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred as casual riders whereas the Customers who purchase annual memberships are called Cyclistic members. 
Cyclistic finance analysts have concluded that members are more profitable than casual riders so the objective of the case study is to find how members use bike differently from casual riders and how can we pursue casual riders to buy the yearly membership.

Me and my team have to make a detailed presentation and present It in front of shareholders to get their approval 

PROCESS

divvy-trip data source has been used to carry out my analysis, the data has been made available by motivate international inc.
The data has high integrity due to its origin from a first party data source But it still has some minor error like null values.
Data set also contained some data that is irrelevant for our analysis.
I have used excel as my choice of tool to carry out my analysis
I have transformed the data using excel functions for example I have created a column named start day that contains the day at which the bike ride start from the date field by using weekday function 

FINDINGS

Through my analysis I have found out two major findings
1 weekdays are more preferred by annual members, Its probably because members mainly use the bikes for travelling to their offices and weekends are more preferred by casual riders, Its probably because casual rider mainly use the bikes for entertainment purposes.
2 summer season Is more preferred by annual members and casual riders and we see a big fall down in winter season
